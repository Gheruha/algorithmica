To find how many divisors a number has we can try each number from the possible divisors interval and see which ones are correct.
Since we know about prime numbers and prime factorization we can use a better way to find how many divisors a number has:

Prime factorization application 1:
e - exponent

Formula: (e1 + 1) * (e2 + 2) * ... * (ek + 1) = nr of possible divisors of n.
Example: 
  12 has the following divisors {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}
  12 is = 2^2 * 3^1

  We can say that 12 is formed of 2^a * 3^a
  Where:
  a can be 0, 1 or 2
  b can be 0 or 1 

  So the nr of possible divisors of 12 is (2 + 1) * (1 + 1) = 3 * 2 = [6] - Correct.
