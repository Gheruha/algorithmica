To find how many divisors a number has we can try each number from the possible divisors interval and see which ones are correct.
Since we know about prime numbers and prime factorization we can use a better way to find how many divisors a number has:

Prime factorization application 1 (How many divisors does n have):
e - exponent

Formula: (e1 + 1) * (e2 + 2) * ... * (ek + 1) = nr of possible divisors of n.
Example: 
  12 has the following divisors {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}
  12 is = 2^2 * 3^1

  We can say that 12 is formed of 2^a * 3^a
  Where:
  a can be 0, 1 or 2
  b can be 0 or 1 

  So the nr of possible divisors of 12 is (2 + 1) * (1 + 1) = 3 * 2 = [6] - Correct.

----------
Prime factorization application 2 (The sum of n's divisors):

To find the sum of n's divisors we can use the sigma function.
In order to be able to prove the sigma function you need to know geometric series and sequences first.
