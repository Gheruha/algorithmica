Definitions:
  A natural number p > 1 is prime if:
    - p|ab => p|a or p|b.
    - d|p => d=1 or d=p.

Observations:
  - 0,1 are not considered prime.
  - If the only divisors of n are 1 and himself then he's prime. 

Verifying if a number is prime: 
  - We can count his divisors, if the the sum of divisors(how many) are 2, then n is prime.
  - We can sum the divisors, if their sum is n + 1, then n is prime.
  - We can search the divisors different from the the number itself or 1, if we don't find, the number is prime.
