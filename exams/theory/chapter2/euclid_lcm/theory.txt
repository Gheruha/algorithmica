Notation: lcm - (least common multiple)\

Example: let a = 12, b = 18.
  Multiples of 12: {12, 24, 36, 48, ...}.
  Multiples of 18: {18, 36, 54, ...}.
  lcm(12,18) = 36.

The most important thing to understand:
  - The product of 2 natural numbers a and b is equal to their gcd times their lcm.
  - a * b = gcd(a,b) * lcm(12,18).
