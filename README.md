# Algorithmica
A long-term, structured collection of algorithms, data structures, and problem solutions
focused on competitive programming, university entrance exams, and interview-style problems.

## Who is this repository for?
This repository is useful if you are:

- Practicing **competitive programming** (Codeforces, pbinfo).
- Solving **LeetCode** problems (easy–medium), including **SQL**.
- Preparing for **informatics entrance exams** (e.g. UBB, TUIASI – Romania).
- Looking for **clean, fast C++ implementations** with explanations.
- Following tutorials from my YouTube channel and need the source code.

This repository is **not** intended for:
- Absolute beginners with no programming background.
- Copy-paste usage without understanding the solutions.

### Repository structure
- `algorithms/` – Core algorithm and data structure implementations, independent of problems.
- `competitive/` – Solutions grouped by platform and difficulty.
- `exams/` – Problems and solutions relevant to Romanian university entrance exams - also **pbinfo** solved questions.
- `data_structures/` – Explanation and implementation of the data structures used (e.g Linked Lists, Trees).

## How to use this repository
- Read the problem statement before opening a solution.
- Try solving the problem yourself first.
- Use the code to compare approaches, not to copy blindly.
- Pay attention to comments.
  
## Future plans for this repository:
- I will mainly work on it as a side project for many years, probably all my software engineer career. I plan to make the contents inside this repository better documented and available.
- Make it more available for those who mainly work in the terminal.
